This project aims to study the properties of Cellular Automata (CA) developmental machines.
Cellular Automata have been studied by von Neumann in the 1940s,
in order to design self-replicating artificial systems inspired to biology.
In 1970 Conway proposed the "game of life" based on CAs.
Our main interest with CA lies in the fact that they are a model of natural computation:
massive parallelism, local interactions, entangled memory and processing,
they show self-organization and self-regulation properties and many other characteristics
that resemble living systems. CA can be considered as discrete dynamic systems and approached as
networks of sparsely connected units (cells). Such networks can be analyzed and evaluated
using the same methods for Boolean Networks and Random Boolean Networks (RBN).
This opens the possibility to generate and visualize attractor basins and the trajectories
from initial state to attractors, which may represent the system behavior.

In this project, CPPN evolved with NEAT are used as novel CA transition functions.
This is a natural continuation of the semester specialisation project. This project may include:

- CPPN input with only neighbours value (local interaction),
  information on physical and environmental characteristics (x,y coordinates, distance from a specific point,
  concentration of chemicals in the environment, etc.)

- Morphogenesis and replication are among the investigated problems.
  Other problems might be considered, e.g. replication loops, morphing of structures, development in 3D,
  computational problems (e.g. square of numbers).

- Evolution might be given control over larger neighbourhood configurations.

- Investigation with novelty search.


Plan (preliminary)
==================

Analysis
    Figure out CA-NEAT measures similar to λ, M, μ
    Relevant considerations:
        - structure of a CPPN
            - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph
            - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytree
            - number of nodes and connections
            - depth: path lengths, shortest, longest, avg, number of possible paths
            - used activation functions
        - Attractors and trajectory lengths
        - Wolfram classes

Experiments
    Dynamic neighbourhood size
        - Norwegian flag morphogenesis
        - Replication problems

    Environment input
        - Border morphogenesis with XY
        - Norwegian flag morphogenesis with XY
        - Input for replication?

    Square computation
        - Try parameters Bidlo used
            - 100 cells
            - 8 states
            - Neigbourhood size ?
            - Square number 2 - 9

    Firing squad synchronization
        - Different/dynamic neighbourhood sizes
        - Different number of states
        - Try dynamic neighbourhood

    Majority problem

    Novelty search
        - Border morphogenesis is a good candidate (as discussed in prev paper)
